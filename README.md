# AST Persistence Project

Repository for the AST Persistence Project (Scala plugin), part of the Palladium project.

## Overview

The AST Persistence Project aims to store ASTs in a compressed way along with the Byte Code in order to allow their interpretation at compile time. The main use of such tool is for Macro expansion, in order to avoid Macros to be precompiled.

The project will be done as an external compiler plugin.
